# PizzaByte - README

## Overview

PizzaByte is a full-stack application designed for pizza restaurant owners and chefs. PizzaByte allows owners to log in to their owner accounts and choose what toppings are available in their restuarant by adding new toppings and updating/removing existing toppings. Duplicate toppings are not allowed. These toppings are used to create "Classics" - customized pizzas that have a specific set of toppings. Chefs can log in using their chef accounts and create their own Classic, or update/remove existing Classic. Classic names must be unique, and no two Classics can have the same set of toppings. Users can log in to their user accounts, however, there is no functionality yet for users. That being said, the platform is set up to eventually allow users to order pizzas.
